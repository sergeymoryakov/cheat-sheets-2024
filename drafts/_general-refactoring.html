        <h2>General: Code Refactoring</h2>
        <p>
            Here's a general approach to refactoring for readability and
            optimization:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> Modularize the Code: </strong> Group related functionality
            into functions or modules. This makes the code easier to read and
            understand at a glance.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> Use Descriptive Variable and Function Names: </strong>
            Names should be self-explanatory. A developer should be able to
            understand the purpose of a variable or function based on its name.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> Avoid Magic Values: </strong> Use named constants instead
            of hard-coded values. For instance, instead of directly using a
            string like "actionItems", you can define a constant
            COLLECTION_NAME.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> Comments and Documentation: </strong> While the code should
            be as self-explanatory as possible, judicious use of comments can
            help explain the purpose of a piece of code, any intricacies, or
            reasons for specific implementations.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> Consistent Formatting: </strong> Ensure consistent
            indentation, use of spaces, and other formatting conventions. This
            makes the code visually clean.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> Error Handling: </strong> Ensure that all possible error
            scenarios are handled. This includes not only handling Firestore
            errors but also potential issues like trying to access properties on
            undefined or null.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> Optimize for Performance: </strong> While this isn't
            strictly about readability, sometimes refactoring can help improve
            performance. For example, avoid unnecessary DOM updates or Firestore
            reads.
        </p>

            <li>
                <h3>Modularize the Code:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Group related functions together. For instance, all
                        utility functions like generateUniqueId can be placed
                        together. Similarly, group event handlers together.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Consider using an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function
                        Expression) to prevent global namespace pollution.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Use Descriptive Variable and Function Names:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Most of your variable names are descriptive, but ensure
                        this consistency throughout. For instance, names like
                        newItemInputNode give a clear understanding of what the
                        variable is for.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Avoid Magic Values:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For strings or values that are used multiple times,
                        consider defining them as constants at the top of your
                        script. This not only makes the code more readable but
                        also easier to maintain.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Comments and Documentation:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You've done a good job commenting the different sections
                        of your code. Continue this practice, especially for
                        complex logic. Remember, comments should explain the
                        "why" and not the "what" (code itself tells the "what").
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Consistent Formatting:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Ensure consistent use of spaces, indentation, and
                        newline breaks. This will make the code easier to scan
                        and read.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Error Handling:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You've incorporated error handling for Firestore
                        operations. Ensure that other potential points of
                        failure, like DOM manipulations or array operations, are
                        also handled gracefully.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Optimize for Performance:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If there are repetitive DOM lookups, consider caching
                        the element in a variable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For operations that could be resource-intensive or
                        repeated often, consider if there are more efficient
                        ways to achieve the same result.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Additional Suggestions:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Event Delegation: Instead of attaching event listeners
                        to each item, consider using event delegation. This
                        means you attach an event listener to a parent element
                        and use logic inside the handler to determine which
                        child was clicked. This is especially useful for lists
                        where items can be dynamically added or removed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Data Manipulation: When dealing with arrays like
                        actionItems, consider using functional programming
                        methods like map, filter, and reduce for
                        transformations. They make the code more readable and
                        declarative.
                    </li>
