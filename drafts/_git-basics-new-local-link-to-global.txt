Let's go through the steps to initialize a Git repository, commit your project, and push it to GitHub.

1. Install Git
If you haven't already installed Git, you can download and install it from Git's official site.
2. Configure Git
Set up your name and email, which will be attached to your commits:
arduino
Copy code
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
3. Initialize a Local Git Repository
Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run:
csharp
Copy code
git init
4. Stage Your Files for Commit
To add all the files in your project to the staging area:
csharp
Copy code
git add .
Or, to add specific files:
php
Copy code
git add <file1> <file2>
5. Commit the Changes
Commit your staged files to your local repository:
sql
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit with Vite-React project setup"
6. Create a Repository on GitHub
Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Do not initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license since your local repository already exists.
7. Link Your Local Repository to GitHub
Copy the remote repository URL from GitHub.
Link your local repository to the remote one:
csharp
Copy code
git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>
To verify the new remote URL:
Copy code
git remote -v
8. Push Your Code to GitHub
Push your commits to the remote repository on GitHub:
perl
Copy code
git push -u origin master
Note: If you're using a branch other than master, replace master with your branch name.
9. Additional Commands and Tips
Checking Status:
lua
Copy code
git status
Viewing Commit History:
bash
Copy code
git log
Ignoring Files: Create a .gitignore file in your project root and list the files/directories you want to ignore.
10. Common Issues
If you encounter any errors, they're often related to conflicts between your local and remote repositories, or authentication issues with GitHub.
