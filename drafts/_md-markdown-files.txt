Markdown (.md) files are used for writing documentation, notes, and content for web pages in a simple-to-read and simple-to-write plain text format. The basic syntax is straightforward and designed to be easy to learn. Here's a quick guide to some of the most common elements:

Headers: Headers are created by using the # symbol before your header text. The number of # symbols indicates the level of the header.

Markdown files are great for documentation because they are readable as plain text but can also be rendered into HTML for a more graphical presentation. This versatility makes them popular for README files, documentation, and more in the coding world.
