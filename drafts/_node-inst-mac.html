        <h2>Node.js: Installation (macOS)</h2>
        <p>
            Visit the official Node.js website at
            <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">https://nodejs.org/en/</a> in your
            web browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the homepage, you'll see two download options: LTS (Long-Term
            Support) and Current. For most users, it's recommended to download
            the LTS version as it provides a more stable and reliable
            environment. Click on the "LTS" button to download the macOS
            installer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the installer is downloaded, double-click on it to launch the
            installation package.
        </p>
        <p>
            Follow the prompts in the installation package and accept the
            license agreement. Leave the default settings as they are unless you
            have specific requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            The installer will copy the necessary files and set up Node.js on
            your macOS system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the installation is complete, open the Terminal application.
            You can find it by going to Applications → Utilities → Terminal.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the Terminal, type the following command to verify the
            installation:
        </p>
        <pre><code>node -v</code></pre>
        <p>
            If you see the version number, it means Node.js is installed
            correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, you can also check the version of npm by running the
            following command in the Terminal:
        </p>
        <pre><code>npm -v</code></pre>
        <p>This will display the version of npm installed on your system.</p>
